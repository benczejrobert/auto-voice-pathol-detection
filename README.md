# Automatic voice pathology detection

This project was originally created with Python 3.7.4, but it runs on Python 3.10.6 as well.

Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` before running the code

The Live-Exp folder contains voice recordings of the author. The healthy recording is a simple pronounciation of the 'a' vowel and the simulated pathological recordings try to imitate the hoarseness in the ventricular dysphonia.
More details can be found in the thesis paper PDF.
